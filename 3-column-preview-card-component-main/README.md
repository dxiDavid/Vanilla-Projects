## Overview

This was a very simple and straight forward challenge to practice my layout skills. My confidence with flexbox is improving. I'm also proud of myself for how close I got to the design. Not that I chase absolute perfection, but I like to get as close I can.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for interactive elements
