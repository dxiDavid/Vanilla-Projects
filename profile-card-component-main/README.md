### Overview

This card card was surprisingly challenging for me to style. It looks deceptively simple but it had me scratching my head on how I would position things. My solution may not be the most efficient but it got me pretty close to the design. If there is a more efficient way to position things in this design please let me know.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Plain CSS

### What I learned

I learned how to use multiple images as background images and generally more about backgrounds. I also looked into the image function in CSS but browser support for it doesn't exist at the time of writing this.

### Useful resources

- [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/@KevinPowell) - This is where I found the best tutorials and explanations (For me) on CSS concepts and      writing functional CSS. This guy really knows his stuff and gives concise explanations.

- [w3schools](https://w3schools.com) - This website has an entire course on CSS with simple examples for both basic and advanced concepts.
