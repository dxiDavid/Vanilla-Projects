## Hello and welcome to my GitHub repository of projects built with vanilla JS. 

In this repository, you will find a collection of web applications that I have created using only plain JavaScript, HTML and CSS. 

- ``No frameworks``, ``no libraries``, ``no dependencies``

Just pure and simple code.

## Brief Overview

The projects range from simple games and calculators to more complex ones. 

Each project has its own folder with a README file that explains 
- how it works 
- what features it has 
- what challenges I faced while building it 
- what I learned

You can also see a live demo of each project by clicking on the link provided in the README file.

## Purpose

I created this repository to showcase my skills and passion for web development, as well as to challenge myself to learn new things and improve my code quality. 

I hope you enjoy browsing through my projects and find them useful or inspiring. I am always open to feedback and suggestions, so feel free to leave a comment or contact me if you have any questions or ideas. Thank you for visiting my repository and happy coding!
