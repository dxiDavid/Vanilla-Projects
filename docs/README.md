### Overview

This one was fairly simple. It is the appropriate size no matter the screen size of the device it is viewed on. It didn't need any media queries or advanced use of CSS. I like the simplicity of the design and it took me a relatively shor amunt of time to complete. I tried to get as close to the design as possible and I can sya I'm 99% there. I'm looking forward to simple challanges like this one since they help to keep your skills sharp.
