## Overview

The most challenging part of this page was to move the image position for the different layouts. The solution I came with was to pre-render both images then change the heights at an appropriate breakpoint.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Receive an error message when the `form` is submitted if:
  - The `input` field is empty
  - The email address is not formatted correctly
